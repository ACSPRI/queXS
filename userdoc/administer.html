<H3 CLASS="western">Adding a sample</H3>
<H4 CLASS="western">Sample list formatting</H4>
<P>queXS requires sample lists to be in <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</A>
form. The first row should contain the name of the column. Most
statistical packages, and Microsoft Excel can export lists in CSV
form. The minimum required for a sample file is a single column
containing a phone number. A sample list containing the name of the
respondent should be formatted with the first name and last name of
the respondent is separate columns. For example:</P>

</UL>
<H3 CLASS="western">Adding operators to the system</H3>
<P>queXS relies on an underlying authentication system (such as
Apache Basic Authentication) to handle authentication of users. Once
they are authenticated, queXS uses the username of the operator to
determine who the operator is, and therefore how to assign work to
them. This means that queXS needs to know the authentication system
username (username only, not password) of each operator on the system
and some other details if using Voice over IP (VoIP).</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>To add an operator to queXS, click on &ldquo;Add operators to
	the system&rdquo;</P>
	<LI><P>Enter the system username</P>
	<LI><P>Enter the first name of the operator, and the last name of
	the operator</P>
	<LI><P>Enter the timezone where the operator is located in (<A HREF="http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/xtra/tzdatepick.html">this
	list may help</A>) it should be in a format such as
	&ldquo;Australia/Victoria&rdquo;</P>
	<LI><P>The telephone extension number must be unique for each
	operator, and is necessary if using VoIP. This is the extension to
	log in as to the VoIP system. queXS will send the extension number
	as the password when logging on.</P>
	<LI><P>The normal interviewer, supervisor and refusal converter
	checkboxes automatically assign skills to the operator. See the
	<A HREF="#skills">Assigning skills to operators</A> section for a
	description of operator skills</P>
</UL>
<H3 CLASS="western">Assigning operators to questionnaires</H3>
<P>When an operator is assigned to a questionnaire they will be
assigned work from that questionnaire. An operator can be added or
removed from a questionnaire at any time.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>To assign an operator to a questionnaire, go to the link:
	&ldquo;Assign operators to questionnaires&rdquo;</P>

<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="skills"></A>Assigning skills to
operators</H3>
<P>Assigning skills to operators is done in a similar fashion to
assigning operators to questionnaires. The following skills are
available:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Temporary outcomes</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P>These are &ldquo;normal&rdquo; cases, such as ones that have
		never been called, or have a previous outcome such as No answer</P>

	</UL>
</UL>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Use the &ldquo;Modify operator skills&rdquo; tool to assign the
appropriate skills to each operator. A &ldquo;normal&rdquo;
interviewer has &ldquo;Temporary&rdquo; and &ldquo;Appointment&rdquo;
assigned to them.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Creating/modifying shifts for a questionnaires</H3>
<P>queXS will usually only assign work to operators if they are
assigned to the questionnaire, have the appropriate skill assigned to
them, and finally that there is a shift available at the current time
for the questionnaire. Defining shifts allows for appointments to be
restricted to times when operators will be available, and to restrict
work to specific hours.</P>
<P>It is desirable to add as many shifts as you know will be run in
advance so that operators will be able to schedule appointments in
them. But conversely, remember not to add shifts if they will not be
run, as appointments may be made for those times.</P>
<P>The shifts listed by default are taken from the shift_template
table, and can be modified by a system administrator.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>To assign shifts to questionnaires, use the &ldquo;Shift
	management (add/remove)&rdquo; tool</P>
	<LI><P>Select the questionnaire to create a shift for</P>
	<LI><P>The current year and week of the year are selected, but these
	may be changed to suit when the shifts need to be added</P>
	<LI><P>Confirm  the shift start and end times, and dates, and select
	the &ldquo;Use shift&rdquo; checkbox if you wish to include that
	shift for this questionnaire 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Click on &ldquo;Submit changes&rdquo; to confirm your shift
	selection</P>
</UL>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Once you have completed all the steps in the &ldquo;Questionnaire
Creation and Management&rdquo; section, the system should be ready to
execute questionnaires. The following sections describe information
about the progress of the questionnaire, and functions for the
supervisor to modify erroneous outcomes or handle cases where the
operator was unsure about what outcome to assign</P>

<H1 CLASS="western">Supervisor functions</H1>
<H3 CLASS="western">Assigning outcomes to cases (and calls)</H3>
