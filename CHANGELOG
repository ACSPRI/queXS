UPDATE `case` SET token = case_id;
ALTER TABLE `case` ADD UNIQUE (`token`);

New outcomes for email invitation and online self completion:

INSERT INTO `outcome` (`outcome_id`, `aapor_id`, `description`, `default_delay_minutes`, `outcome_type_id`, `tryanother`, `contacted`, `tryagain`, `eligible`, `require_note`, `calc`) VALUES
(40, '1.1', 'Self completed online', 0, 4, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 'I'),
(41, '2.36', 'Self completion email invitation sent', 10080, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 'O');

New sample variable type (Email address):

INSERT INTO `sample_var_type` (`type`, `description`, `table`) VALUES
(8, 'Email address', '');

Specify details of respondent self completion:

ALTER TABLE `questionnaire` ADD `self_complete` TINYINT( 1 ) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0' AFTER `info`,
ADD `lime_mode` VARCHAR( 64 ) NULL COMMENT 'Limesurvey mode for respondent self completion' AFTER `self_complete` ,
ADD `lime_template` VARCHAR( 128 ) NULL COMMENT 'Limesurvey template for respondent self completion' AFTER `lime_mode` ,
