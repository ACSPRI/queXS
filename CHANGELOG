Changes for session authentication:

queXS now uses the Limesurvey session based authentication system to authenticate all users.

If this is a fresh install - you can ignore the notes below. Otherwise - please read through 
the following for converting from directory based authentication to session based authentication.

File changes for session authentication:

If you have used the example .htaccess files or created your own, and you want to move to purely
session based authentication, you can remove these files. They are typcially at these locations:

.htaccess
client/.htaccess
admin/.htaccess
include/limesurvey/.htaccess
include/limesurvey/admin/.htaccess

This will remove restrictions for access via directory based authentication and rely solely on session authentication.

Database changes for session authentication:

These queries will:
1. Make the first queXS user an admin user, and assign them the password "password"
2. Make all other users regular users, and assign them the password "password"
3. Make all clients regular clients, and assign them the password "password"

Once you have run these - please go to the operator management page and update passwords for all users AND reassign any extensions.

/* Make the first user the admin user - with default password of: password */
INSERT INTO `lime_users` (`users_name`, `password`, `full_name`, `parent_id`, `lang`, `superadmin`) 
SELECT username, 0x35653838343839386461323830343731353164306535366638646336323932373733363033643064366161626264643632613131656637323164313534326438, firstName, 0, 'auto', 1
FROM operator
WHERE operator_id = 1;

/* Make all other users operators - with default password of: password */
INSERT INTO `lime_users` (`users_name`, `password`, `full_name`, `parent_id`, `lang`, `superadmin`)

/* Remove redundant table */
DROP TABLE `sessions2`;

/* Add sort order feature to questionnaire sample table */
/* after update just open "Assign & Sort questionnaire samples" admin page (assignsample.php) and set required sort_order*/
ALTER TABLE `questionnaire_sample` ADD `sort_order` INT( 11 ) NOT NULL DEFAULT '1';

/* -- add `default` and `permanent` parameters for outcomes -- */
ALTER TABLE `outcome` ADD `default` TINYINT(1) UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT '1' COMMENT 'Used as default for questionnaire outcomes' AFTER `calc`, ADD `permanent` TINYINT(1) UNSIGNED NOT NULL COMMENT 'Permanent outcome, used for all questionnaires, not possible to de-select' AFTER `default`;

/* -- define and set mandatory(constant) outcome_id's --*/
UPDATE `outcome` SET `permanent` = '1' WHERE `outcome`.`outcome_id` IN (1,2,3,7,9,10,14,17,18,19) ;

/* -- set AUTO_INCREMENT to 100 @ `outcome` to reserve some id's -- */
ALTER TABLE `outcome` AUTO_INCREMENT = 100;

/* -- add `outcomes` parameter ,  define default list of outcome_ID's to be enabled for new questionnaries --*/
ALTER TABLE `questionnaire` ADD `outcomes` VARCHAR(256) NULL DEFAULT '1,2,3,7,9,10,14,17,18,19' COMMENT 'Comma-separated string of outcomes defined for the questionnaire' AFTER `enabled`;

/* -- enable all outcomes for existing questionnaires -- */
UPDATE `questionnaire` SET `outcomes` = '1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,40,41,42,43,44,45' ;


!!-- IMPORTANT --!! 
If you had more than 1 sample assigned to a questionaire before "samplesort" update, you'll need to have different sort_order values (llike 0,1,2 e.t.c.)for each sample per questionnaire to make "samplesort" feature work.

Easy way: unassign samples from quesionnaires (no more than 1 could be left per questionnaire)  and reassign them back.

Check that you have different "Sort order" values for each sample per questionnaire, test order change with up/down arrows.
!!

queXS 1.13.1 - Changes since 1.13.0
