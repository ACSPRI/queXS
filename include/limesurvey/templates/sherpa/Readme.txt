This LimeSurvey Template is kindly provided by LimeSurvey User "jmblum"

His description of this template:
The templates that come with LimeSurvey are all a bit of a mess from a HTML 
perspective, using tables with font statements, etc. That is why I have 
created a CSS based template which replaces most of the tables with 
div statements (though I use a table for the top graphic look).
